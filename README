To customize config.h, open the config.h file and pick the LEVELS and the POBITS you want your pagetable to have. The values chosen in config.h will affect the levels and offset bits the pagetable will have, with LEVELS representing the levels of the pagetable and POBITS the number of offset bits.

The deallocation interface I propose is a one function interface that deallocates everything allocated by page_allocate: void page_deallocate();. However this would not be practical as it would require too much change to the page_allocate and translate implementations. The changes that would need to be made to page_allocate and translate to implement the deallocation interface effectively would be iterating through the levels backward in the for loops for page_allocate and translate. This causes the implementation for deallocation interface ineffective as it would result in calculating the vpn and iterating through levels much more difficult.
