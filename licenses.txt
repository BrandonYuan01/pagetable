First license considered: GPL
This license stands for general public license, and is very commonly used for free and open source software, and gives users multiple rights, including running, sharing, and modifying the code.
Most notably, any derivative works must also have the same rights, but I didn't choose this license because it didn't give the user as much freedom as MIT.

Second license considered: LGPL
This license is like GPL, except it doesn't ensure that derivative works also have the same rights. I didn't choose this license because it didn't give the user as much freedom as MIT.

Third license considered: MIT
This license gives users almost full freedom, except they must also include the license and a copyright notice. I chose this license because it offered the most freedom of the 3 choices
